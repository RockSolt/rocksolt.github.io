Business is the story of an employee that gets hired, gets promoted, and gets a raise. It is the story 
of an order that gets submitted, fulfilled, and delivered.

Good software helps to tell that story. It fills in the blanks and brings expected context to bear. It
records these stories, and it even predicts the next story.

What's the secret to this story telling? It is as much art as it is science. It's probably less about the
technology than most of us in the industry want to admit. Mostly—like in any good story—it is about the
participants. The people and the process should drive good software.

Does your business have a story to tell?
